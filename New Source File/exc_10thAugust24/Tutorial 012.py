# Subtraction , Multiplication , Division

a = 10
b = 10
c = 20

sum = a + b + c
print(sum) # It will give out put as a 40

sum = sum - 11
print(sum) # It will give out put as a 29 because above sum is latest its answer is 40 so 40-11 = 29

sum = sum + 1
print(sum) # It will give out put as a 30 because above sum [sum=sum-11] is latest its answer is 29 so 29+1 = 30

sum + 1 # This is not storing a value it is just a increment.

print(sum) # It will give out put as a 30 only because above expression [sum + 1] is not storing any value
# , so above of that lates expression is [sum = sum + 1] and its out put is 30 , so gies u a output 30 only.

sum = sum + 1
print(sum) # It will give out put as a 31 only because above expression [sum + 1] is not storing any value
# , so above of that latest expression is [sum = sum + 1] and its out put is 30 , so answer is 30 + 1 = 31
